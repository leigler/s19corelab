# Student Index

1.<br>Please take a moment to create a new repository and upload a basic `index.html` page to it. 

Once you&rsquo;re finished, please paste your Github page&rsquo;s url to [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zE5ivKD0-lFiQn0KuALmsSwywqHgJrVA0C6XDJYLLOI/edit?usp=sharing).

<br>2.<br>Spend the first hour of today&rsquo;s class building a single-page index with two sections that are clearly separated:

## Section 1:
This should be a list of your projects so far in chronological order. You may choose to divide this section into two subsections (Lab: Squares, Media Query, Studio: The Dialogue), or keep the entire collection of links grouped together. Consider what information you show about each project (Ex: Name, Date, Description, Reaction, Resources Used) and how this section may grow over the semester.

## Section 2:
This section should present links to your fellow student&rsquo;s repositories (as listed on the google sheet). Consider what organizing principles you may introduce into this grouping. Is it alphabetical? Randomly placed? A grid? A map?  

Once you are finished, push your changes to Github.
