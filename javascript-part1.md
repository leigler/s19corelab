# Javascript Part 1

variables

number, string, boolean, array, object, function

- conditionals and operators

	if( >, <, ==, ===, >=, <=, ||, && ){

	}else if(){

	}else{

	}

- events: 
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
	- "things that have taken place in the browser" for us, this mainly means user interactions, but also small things like loading:
	object.onclick = function(){ };
	object.onmouseout = function(){ };
	object.onmouseout = function(){ };

- adding classes (using arrays)
	- classList.remove, classList.add, classList.toggle
	- advantages are abstraction

- adding css
	.style.attribute = ""
