# S19 Core Lab Interaction

This course serves as a complement to Core Studio Interaction. The assignments are build to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML and CSS.
