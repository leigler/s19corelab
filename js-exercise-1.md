# Javascript Exercise 1

Create a simple interactive webpage that is based on one of the patterns or images presented in the Anni Albers On Weaving pdf. You may abstract the image as much as you'd like, but be sure to have the original image (as a screenshot) somehow linked or embedded in your design. 

Your webpage should utilize the `click` event (or any other interaction-based event) to reveal/hide and grow/progress parts of the site.
